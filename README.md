# Gamble-on-Earnings

## Introduction

It's found that around 75% ~ 80% listed company in S&P 500 report earnings higher than expected. From my experience, they usually surge about 6% ~ 7% when outperformed. So I built a model using Monte Carlo method to calculate the expected earnings for every report and select the best invest pattern, eg. all in before every earning report or use part of it every time.

## Rough Conclusion
As a quick result if you haven't run the program, all in is the best method and the expected rate of return for every earning report is 2%(assuming winning profit 5%).
